### What is it?

The Code Manifesto is the brain child of [Kayla Daniels](http://twitter.com/kayladnls).
It was was born from frustration with the current state of the technology industry. It is simply
a set of values that can all be combined and boiled down into a simple premise: Respect Each Other.

The idea behind the Manifesto is that if more people held these values, and kept them top of mind,
our industry would be a better place.

### Who is it for?

It is for everyone. Developers. Project Managers. Business owners. Conference organizers and attendees.
We exclude no one.

### What can I do to help?

Support it. Talk about it. Encourage others to support it.

This is an open source effort. The Manifesto is available on [github](http://github.com/kayladnls/code-manifesto).

Pull requests are welcomed the only thing we ask is that additions are made in the form of 'values',
rather than 'actions'.

Additionally, if you are a designer and would like to contribute, your help would be greatly appreciated. You can contact Kayla [here](mailto:kayladnls@gmail.com).
