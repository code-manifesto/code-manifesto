    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    The Code Manifesto is the brain child of <a href="http://twitter.com/kayladnls">Kayla Daniels</a>.
    It was was born from frustration with the current state of the technology industry. It is simply
    a set of values that can all be combined and boiled down into a simple premise: Respect Each Other.

    The idea behind the Manifesto is that if more people held these values, and kept them top of mind,
    our industry would be a better place.

    <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
    It is for everyone. Developers. Project Managers. Business owners. Conference organizers and attendees.
    We exclude no one.

    <h3>What can I do to help?</h3>
    Support it. Talk about it. Encourage others to support it.

    <br>
    This is an open source effort. The Manifesto is available on <a href="http://github.com/kayladnls/code-manifesto">github</a>.
    Pull requests are welcomed the only thing we ask is that additions are made in the form of 'values',
    rather than 'actions'.
